                <p>
                    On <a href="https://relay.fm/cortex"><em>Cortex</em></a>, it's super interesting to hear how Grey and Myke
                    give insights into the tools – both software and hardware –
                    they use to complete their work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I really love their <a href="https://relay.fm/cortex/133">episodes on <abbr title="Artifical Intelligence">AI</abbr> and its art</a>
                    as well as their yearly themes episodes, where they take a look
                    both the way they've been approaching their work overt the last 
                    year, and how they want to focus on the next.

                <h3>Rock, Paper, Scissors</h3>
                <p>
                    In <a href="https://youtu.be/PmWQmZXYd74?si=S8Xa4Ir9WGwQcMms"><em>Rock, Paper, Scissors</em></a>
                    you get to weave your way through a maze of probability,
                    rampaging with rock, slicing with scissors,
                    and plotting with paper, to conquer unimaginable odds
                    in surprisingly few games.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When playing for the first time, I urge you to be honest
                    about whether you were truly victorious or not.
                    If you lose, you must click the lose link, for to corrupt
                    your initial expierience with cheater malice, would truly
                    ruin your expierience of the video.
                    And, most importantly, if you lose the first time
                    <strong>don't just click off the video</strong>. There is a
                    dedicated end card link for if you are defeated, which, if
                    clicked, opens up a whole new world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now go! Venture through the unlikely undertaking and see if you
                    will be the luckiest person to ever live.
                </p>
                <p>I mean, you probably won't, but it's worth a shot at least.</p>
