                        On <a href="https://relay.fm/cortex"><em>Cortex</em></a>, it's super interesting to hear how Grey and Myke
                        give insights into the tools – both software and hardware –
                        they use to complete their work.

                    <p>
                        I really love their <a href="https://relay.fm/cortex/133">episodes on <abbr title="Artifical Intelligence">AI</abbr> and its art</a>
                        as well as their yearly themes episodes, where they take a look
                        both the way they've been approaching their work overt the last
                        year, and how they want to focus on the next.

                        In <a href="https://youtu.be/PmWQmZXYd74?si=S8Xa4Ir9WGwQcMms"><em>Rock, Paper, Scissors</em></a>
                        you get to weave your way through a maze of probability,
                        rampaging with rock, slicing with scissors,
                        and plotting with paper, to conquer unimaginable odds
                        in surprisingly few games.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When playing for the first time, I urge you to be honest
                        about whether you were truly victorious or not.
                        If you lose, you must click the lose link, for to corrupt
                        your initial expierience with cheater malice would truly
                        ruin your expierience of the video.
                        And, most importantly, if you lose the first time
                        <strong>don't just click off the video</strong>. There is a
                        dedicated end card link for if you are defeated, which, if
                        clicked, opens up a whole new world.

                    <p>
                        Now go! Venture through the unlikely undertaking and see if you
                        will be the luckiest person to ever live.
                    </p>
                    <p>I mean, you probably won't, but it's worth a shot at least.</p>

                        <a href="https://youtu.be/gMqZR3pqMjg?si=8XBmzHLSDi8Qq_3d"><em>The surprising pattern of color names</em></a>
                        is a video from <a href="https://www.vox.com">Vox</a> exploring the 
                        way that cultures all across the world seem to give colours 
                        their names in pretty much the same order, even through
                        there is no obvious reason why some colours are more
                        important to name than others.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To me, the introduction of this video is just spectacular.
                        It immediately does a great job at getting the viewer
                        intrigued, and then swiftly presents the topic at hand
                        in a way which gets you curious to learn more.

                        The animation and sound are both done great as well, which helps
                        elevate the experience.
